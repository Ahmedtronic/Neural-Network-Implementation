# Neural-Network-Implementation
In this repo, an implementation of a basic fully connected neural network using C++


## This implementation is customizable, at it consits of the following classes: 

- Training Data : for getting the data to be fed into the network 
- Neuron : the main part of each layer which holds the values to be updated during the backporpagation process
- Net : The Neural Network itself which consists of number of layers and each one has number of neurons 


## The Main Pipeline: 

- Create an instance of the Neural Network 
- Feed The Data into the Network 
- Backpropagate the Neural Network ( the training process ) 
- Show the Results

** More Advanced Implementations are coming soon. **
